# Welcome to Aqwam's MatrixL Library!

MatrixL is a matrix library for Lua.

Although there are other matrix libraries available, this was created to avoid legal issues when creating [DataPredict](https://github.com/AqwamCreates/DataPredict) library.

If there are any suggestions or issues for this library, don't be afraid to reach out to me at my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aqwam-harish-aiman/).
